### How it works
1. Clone/download the repository and then go to template/src/App.cpp and edit your file as you want
2. If you want to add additional .cpp files to your ImGui project go to template/src/Makefile and add your file there

### IMPORTANT

THIS ONLY WORKS FOR USERS WHO USE GLFW_OPENGL3 as their backend, if you use vulkan or directX, it won't work.
<b>This was tested on MacOSX</b>
